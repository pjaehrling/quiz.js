A small script to manage a quiz game.
Questions and times can be configured through a JSON-file.

Gulpfile to minify the code is included.
Run "npm install" to install all dependencies.

"example.html", "style.css" and the "js/script.js" are an example on how to use the quiz-script.

Work in progress...
